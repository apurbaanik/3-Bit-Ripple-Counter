# 3-Bit-Ripple-Counter
About building a 3-Bit Ripple Counter using D Flip Flop with a reset input and we will verify the correct operation by simulating a testbench. Before we talk about ripple counter, we need to understand the function of a D Flip Flop. D Flip Flop is one of the most widely used storage device in a sequential logic. D Flip Flop is basically a Flip Flop with one data input that stores the value of that input signal in its memory at the clock edges. It is similar to the D-Latch except that the store mode is triggered by a transition or the edge on the clock signal. With D Flip Flop, we can implement higher frequency system because the outputs are updated in a short amount of time and it restricts all the noises from corrupting the data stored by excluding all the input transitions at all other times.
